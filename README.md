## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Requirements
* **The .NET SDK** (version 9.0) installed.

### Steps
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/MealPrepHelper.git](https://github.com/your-username/MealPrepHelper.git)
    cd MealPrepHelper
    ```

2.  **Restore packages:**
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

> **Note regarding the database:** Upon the first launch, the application automatically creates the `mealprep.db` file and seeds it with test data (recipes, ingredients, admin account) via the `DbInitializer` class.

## 🗂 Project Structure

The project follows a strict MVVM structure:

* 📂 **Models:** Database entities (`User`, `Recipe`, `Ingredient`, `PantryItem`...).
* 📂 **ViewModels:** Application logic, DB connection, ReactiveCommands (`OverviewViewModel`, `CalendarViewModel`...).
* 📂 **Views:** XAML files defining the UI (`UserControl`, `Window`).
* 📂 **Data:** Database context (`AppDbContext`) and initializer (`DbInitializer`).
* 📂 **Services:** Helper classes (`NutritionCalculator`, `PasswordHelper`).

---

## 🔑 Demo Credentials

The application creates a demo user upon the first launch:

* **Login:** `Admin`
* **Password:** `admin123`

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Error: "SQLite Error 1: 'no such column'..."**
If you have modified the data model (e.g., added a new property to `User`), the database schema might be outdated.
* **Solution:** Delete the `mealprep.db` file in the project folder and restart the application. A new DB with the current structure will be created.

## 📝 Roadmap (To-Do)

* [ ] Recipe Editor (allow users to create custom recipes).
